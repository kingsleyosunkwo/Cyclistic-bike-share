### Project Overview
The project focuses on conducting a detailed analysis of Cyclistic bike-share data from Chicago to uncover insights that will support strategic marketing decisions. Cyclistic is aiming to maximize annual memberships by understanding how different customer segments (annual members vs. casual riders) utilize their bike-share service differently. The analysis will involve exploring trip data over the past 12 months to identify patterns, trends, and behaviors among Cyclistic users. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations that will help Cyclistic convert casual riders into annual members through targeted marketing strategies backed by data-driven insights.
