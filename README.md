### Project Overview
The project focuses on conducting a detailed analysis of Cyclistic bike-share data from Chicago to uncover insights that will support strategic marketing decisions. Cyclistic is aiming to maximize annual memberships by understanding how different customer segments (annual members vs. casual riders) utilize their bike-share service differently. The analysis will involve exploring trip data over the past 12 months to identify patterns, trends, and behaviors among Cyclistic users. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations that will help Cyclistic convert casual riders into annual members through targeted marketing strategies backed by data-driven insights.

### Business Task
The business task is to analyze Cyclistic bike-share data to understand how annual members and casual riders utilize the service differently. Specifically, the analysis aims to uncover behavioral patterns, usage trends, and preferences of these customer segments. The insights derived will inform the development of a new marketing strategy focused on converting casual riders into annual members. The strategy will be data-driven, leveraging findings from the analysis to enhance customer retention and maximize annual memberships, thereby driving long-term growth for Cyclistic.
